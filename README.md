## Tomb

Tomb is an open-source secure message sharing tool that prioritizes data encryption to safeguard your information. It offers easy deployment options, either manual setup or through Docker.

### Development

Tomb is currently in the development phase and should be used with caution. It lacks essential features and security measures, making it unsuitable for reliable usage at this time.

### Roadmap

Here's an overview of the planned roadmap for Tomb's development:

- [ ] P2P message inventory
- [ ] Expanded database support
- [ ] Authentication implementation
- [ ] NextJS frontend application
- [ ] Completion of Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

By following this roadmap, Tomb aims to enhance its functionality, scalability, and security to provide a more comprehensive solution for secure message sharing.
